 1422840011553222659^franz kafka^@gwcollinge @uk_domain_names Oh, and to cap it all. In NI CE certification remains legal and there will be no barriers to trade from NI to UK. Which means ce certified goods from NI will be apparently legal in GB. Pure Kafka.
 1422840549246128136^franz kafka^The biggest problem of the movie was its marketing. They marketed the movie in a way which created a wrong impression. Same thing goes to Jagga Jasoos and Kashyap’s No smoking. Don’t market a Kafka movie with a Bipasha basu’s item song   #4YearsOfJHMS #JHMS

 1422847949105557504^franz kafka^@Einqalaab Frida & Kafka would truly make a great pair.

 1422850110489309186^franz kafka^#RabbitMQ is a smart #MessageBroker, unlke #Kafka. Can it be programmed to ensure there are no traffic delays, even when your #MarketingAutomation tool clients send out 10 million messages at once? 😲 Learn more:  #EngineeringPowerhouse #WorldsConnected  https://t.co/nJXul4Eyva

 1422853576695689216^franz kafka^This topic (😁) got me hooked. I took the tutorial from @alexellisuk  and added an automation to it.  With @PulumiCorp and @golang , we provison a k8s on @linode, get Kafka from @aiven_io and deploy @openfaas Pro  🔥🔥 on top. No ✋ needed.  https://t.co/3tysSAdJNp
 1422853835261894658^franz kafka^Eventually I still want to A3 Maggie, Odi, Kafka, Jane, Cuscuta, Leona, Areia, Mia, Chandra and Patty and Pattsy but looking at that list I'm sure you can understand why I'm planning on taking an A3ing break

 1422861898194714627^franz kafka^LOL, even Kafka would not have thought of this.  Must be a nightmare for the paper authors.  Maybe next time they should cite their arxiv preprint and discuss how their method is better?
 1422862190076432385^franz kafka^@scorpiiofemme omg pachinko and kafka on the shore are my FAVS!!!

 1422864327904833537^franz kafka^@echodaz Struggling to remember the author who wrote a novel about being trapped inside a bureaucracy, a European chap. Might have been Kafka. Barmy but sinister plot.

 1422869073260470276^franz kafka^@Purplemelorain God i couldn't finish kafka at all. I should try giving it a shot again
 1422870386488795139^franz kafka^First @alexellisuk took OpenFaaS and added our Kafka service to it. Then @_ediri took it a step further and automated it all, deploying functions and the Aiven managed service integration all with Pulumi - and shared it as a GitHub repo.  Building and sharing tech is fun!
 1422870993123659779^franz kafka^The new eroticism is like that of the gramophone which as Kafka remarked in the time.

 1422876082290581506^franz kafka^Seriously, it's not worth engaging with them and explaining why one is fine and the other isn't, because they never operate in good faith and will lay down kafka traps the entire time. There is no convincing them. Show them the door (and your boot).
 1422876797910269953^franz kafka^@1996GGGGGG @Femi_Sorry Kafka is alive and every where
 1422880805144121346^franz kafka^Having conclusively failed to be claimed from outside our house (even Novelli got taken!), I'm thrilled to announce that Barbara Kafka's seminal "Microwave Gourmet" is now available from the phone booth library on #Lewisham Way/Tyrwhitt Road. Will anyone fall for its charms? 🤔 https://t.co/gqMjHRu7f3
