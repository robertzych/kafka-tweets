 1422174089360379906~null~@gunnarmorling The need for state store is just one thing. Making any assumptions about the input data on the broker side (other than “just a bunch of bytes”) is another. This may probably be better suited for Kafka Streams, but still feels quite app-specific to me…
 1422175003538300928~null~@mikemybytes I don't think Kafka Streams is the right tool for the job, it's too "late" then already. Those assumptions you're referring to could be a simple as the previous offset for a given key. If there was a broker-side interceptor API, one could implement as sort of a plug-in.
